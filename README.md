# Iris Flower Classification with SVM

In this project, I built a machine learning model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify flowers from the Iris dataset. The process included data exploration, scaling, and training the model. I evaluated its performance using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. I also fine-tuned the model with hyperparameter optimization and saved it for future use. The project further included cross-validation and visualizations of the confusion matrix and decision boundaries to assess model performance.
