# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification with SVM

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning classification model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the classic Iris dataset.
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features.

The workflow covers the entire ML pipeline:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Model persistence (saving & loading)
- Performance visualization (confusion matrix, decision boundaries)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thurawk/Iris-Flower-Classification-with-SVM.git
cd Iris-Flower-Classification-with-SVM
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python iris_svm.py
```

## ## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Accuracy**: ~95â€“100% (depending on kernel & hyperparameters)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
